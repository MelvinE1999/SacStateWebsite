# SacStateWebsite

The website was created for our computer science 131 class at Sacramento State University. The functioning website can be seen <a href="https://commuteoptions.herokuapp.com/home">here</a>.

## Purpose

Design a webpage to guide a student (or faculty/staff member) through their commute options for Sacramento State.  Single Occupant Vehicle is the “most natural (default) mode” for most students, but is it the best option after weighing the impacts of each transportation option?
  
The goal is to show the Commute Options and the Real Cost of each option in terms of money and Sustainability. For more information about this project and its objectives, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DlETYtVPxVhK3omdQet32H-TLwkuKZD_/view?usp=sharing">click here</a>.
