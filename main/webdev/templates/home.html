      <p>Commuting to campus can be a very stressful experience for many new stuents. Traffic, car problems, and parking are some of the many obstacles students may face on a daily basis when choosing to commute to campus in single occupant cars.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to inform students about other options avaiable to them in order to decide whether or not commuting to campus in single occupant cars is the best choice for them.</p>
